# Locating the best place for your business using Data Analysis and GeoLocation

A lot of individual events have been registered since 18th century with the development of navigation around the oceans. In modern times, scientific societies have tried to standarize the registers throu an universal questionary where information like place, time, activity, shark specie or victims' personal details have been stored. Despite that, there are still a lot of unstandarized answers in those questionaries.

## Goal

Our task as data analysts is to clean data through all those singularities, and aggregate information to extract all kinds of conclusions.

We need to clean the data with an array (pun intended) of techniques, and store this data in a clean data-set. Then, we will have to set three aprioristic hypotheses and confirm or discard them via data exploratory analysis. This conclusions should be shown graphically with the most appropiate charts.

## What is in this repo

In this repository you will find:

 - A readmi.md file with information about the project (this document).
 
 - A "Main" jupyter notebook with the methods for the data cleaning. As an output, it exports a csv file with the clean data ready to be further analysed.
 
## Libraries

In this project we have used the following libraries:

 - pandas   https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/
 
 - numpy   https://numpy.org/doc/stable/
 
 - plotly   https://plotly.com/python/
 
 - seaborn   https://seaborn.pydata.org/
 
 - our own "cleaning_functions.py"
